# Fix My Code
# Before:
ðŸ‘‰ # Solve the following problems with my code
# Your goal is to print the solution of all 3 calculations to the screen.

# multiplication
3.4 * 6.8

# division
2467 / 4673

#raise 10 to the power of 2

# print the remainder when 343 is divided by 4
print("343 // 100")

# After
print(3.4 * 6.8)

print(2467 / 4673)

print(10**2)

print(343 % 4)
