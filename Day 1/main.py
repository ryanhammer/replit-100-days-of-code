I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes per day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone (if needed) wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling 😁
